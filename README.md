Reporting & Monitoring

## What is Data & Information Visualization?
Data visualization is the graphical representation of information and data. By using visual elements like charts, graphs, and maps, data visualization tools provide an accessible way to see and understand trends, outliers, and patterns in data. Additionally, it provides an excellent way for employees or business owners to present data to non-technical audiences without confusion.

## Project 5
Project 5 expected the student to gain fundemental knowledge with respect to Data Visualization and Data Monitoring. The student was expected to link a live data source in the form of an excel file located on an accesible SharePoint site. This ensures the displayed data would be "live", meaning any changes would reflect upon a refresh.

The tool used for Visualization was PowerBI, specifically Power BI Desktop. Once the data was configured (imported/connected), the student then had to logically map, transform and use the data by displaying it in various ways. 

## How to use the Project
The user can download the report from the repository. They can then open the project in Power BI Desktop or view the published project on a workspace. The connection to the dataset is done via organisational authentication.

Once the report is opened, the user can view one of 3 pages:
# 1.High-Level Metrics
# 2.Device Monitoring
# 3.Device Registration
