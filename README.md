## What is a RPA?

Robotic process automation (RPA) is a software technology that makes it easy to build, deploy, and manage software robots that emulate humans actions interacting with digital systems and software. Just like people, software robots can do things like understand whatâ€™s on a screen, complete the right keystrokes, navigate systems, identify and extract data, and perform a wide range of defined actions.

## Project 5

This project required us to get familiar with two concepts, RPA and UAT. By using the web application used in both project 2 and 3, we now have to test the solution (being the web application) using the CRUD metod. We were expected to perform CRUD operations on Zones, Categories as well as Devices. 

This can be done by building an RPA solution and is especialy applicable in this scenario since all the operations have to be carried out by interacting with the web application Ui elements. The RPA process needs to read inpu data, perform the CRUD operation and then update a result sheet used for tracking.


## How to use the Project

There are two (main) ways a user can use the solution:

1.) The user can clone the project and open in a local instance of UiPath Studio (any version), they can then simply run the entire process and watch it perform the CRUD    operations.

2.) Since the solution is published to an instance of UiPath Orchestrator, provided the user has access to the Orchestrator and is connected, the user may also launch the process directly from their robot tray or from Orchestrator.
